# Pre-work - _Memory Game_

**Simon** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: **Isaiah Kroeker**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [#] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [#] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [#] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [#] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [#] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [#] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [#] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [#] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [#] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [#] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [#] Color is procedural off of hue. Allows arbitrary amount of buttons. (Changed in code by variable)
- [#] Sound is procedural considering musical key. Again allowing any amount of buttons.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.<br>
  &emsp;W3Schools (usage reference for tags and functions)<br>
  &emsp;StackOverflow (troubleshooting a problem)

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)<br>
   &emsp;When making this color matching game, I tried to make the amount of buttons easier to change. I chose to try and make them generated by the JavaScript rather than make them hard coded into the HTML. My first challenge was making buttons that not only existed on the HTML, but also existed in the code. The idea I went with was to make a Button class that contained the information needed for the code as well as a reference to the button element. I encountered some minor issues with how to append the button element to the HTML page but with a few references from W3Schools, I got that working. The real problem was when I assigned the onmouseup and onmousedown functions. Because these functions were called by the element on the page rather than the object, while I was using this.<variable> it would not work. I thought of the idea that I might be able to make the button element also have a reference to the button class. But I ended up making a reference to the button object before assigning the functions and then just referencing it inside them. Another way I may have been able to get around this is by making the button element all that existed (no class). But I still chose to keep the class because it allowed the JavaScript to control the appearance and the changes in the button for things like cues.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)<br>
  &emsp;One of my questions is how web development is usually done. I have spent a lot of time programming with HTML/JavaScript. But my most recent class used ReactJS as a back-end and MongoDB as a database. Is it common to do web development in HTML and JavaScript more than it is to do it in ReactJS, sending a packaged HTML object as a response?<br>
  &emsp;I guess another question I have is more about my approach. I made the buttons procedural generated rather than programmed into the HTML so that you could just change the number of buttons in a variable and it works the same. Was this a smart decision? On one hand it makes it easier to make a change. But on the other hand it could possible take more load time and is harder to customize the colors / sounds.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)<br>
   &emsp;If I had a few more hours, I would probably spend time adding to the display. Of course I’d really enjoy to refactor a few functions here and there. But I have already spent a great deal of time doing so. So for the most part this step is done. Although I would like to take another look at my logic for what actions are available whether it is your turn or the game is started. It seems to work perfectly, but I haven’t spent a lot of time exploring the state diagram and conditional logic.<br>
   &emsp;But back to the display. This game currently has the ability to generate any number of buttons just by changing a variable. Although this is only usable by the programmer currently. If it still would fall within the requirements, it might be good to allow the ability to change the amounts of buttons. This can either be done by adding a box to select how many buttons. But if that is not preferred, and it would be better to keep the display as is, it could be done by using the URL parameters system.
